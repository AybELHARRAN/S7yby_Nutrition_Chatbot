If you want to change your appearance or performance by building muscle, remember you don’t need to overdo it: most men only need about 0.84 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, which is about 60 grams a day for an 80 kilogram man. So what does 60 grams of protein look like on your plate? There’s about 60 grams of protein in 100 grams of rump steak and 12.4 grams of protein in 40 grams of reduced fat cheese. So it’s not much – and it’s easy to achieve if you’re eating protein-rich foods like meat, poultry, fish, dairy, legumes and lentils, eggs and nuts.To manage your weight, you will need to limit high kilojoule drinks, such as soft drinks, energy drinks and alcohol."]

As men get older, the key is choosing foods that give you bang for your buck – that is, foods that are nutrient-rich, without excessive kilojoules. You need slightly less of some food groups, such as lean meats and eggs, tofu, nuts and seeds. You’ll also need to watch your ‘extras’ or ‘sometimes foods’ – commercial burgers, pizza, alcohol, lollies, cakes and biscuits, fried foods, and fruit juices and cordials – for weight management."]
