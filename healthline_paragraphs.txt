But for many of us, it's more effective to use multiple small meals andhealthy snacksspread throughout the dayÂ help you fuel your body and keep your blood-sugar levels under controlÂ asÂ your metabolismÂ adapts to the stimulus from training.

Limit Processed Foods:Â Removing high-calorie, nutrient-poor foods from your diet and your life will help you stick to your meal plan.Â If you're like most people, you'll find your workouts feel better, your cravings will decrease, and you'll see the difference in the mirror!Â Â

Stay Hydrated:ÂDrink waterand calorie-free beverages to keep your body at peak performance. Avoid sugar-laden drinks that sabotage your body's defense systems. Craving sweetÂ drinks? Low-calorieÂbranched-chain amino acid blendsÂ can be a lifesaver.

Strategize Your Carb Intake:Â Carbs come in two forms: starchy, faster-action options such as rice, bread,Â and pasta that raise the blood sugar quickly; and non-starchy carbs like fruits, vegetables,Â and whole grains, which are higher in fiber and raise blood sugar gradually. Non-starchy carbsÂ should be the backbone of yourcarb intake.Â The timing of when you eat starchy carbs is key to getting and maintaining a lean and muscular body.Â Theyâre bestÂ before orimmediately after your workouts, when you can use them as fuel or to replenish muscle glycogen.

Eat Plenty ofÂ Lean Protein:Â You can maximize muscle growth while stimulating the release of fat-burning hormonesÂ by eating protein every few hours. If youâre only going to measure one macronutrient,make it this one!Â WhileÂhigh-proteinÂ foodsÂ should always be yourÂ first priority, aquality protein powderÂ is an easy, healthy wayÂ to meetÂ your protein goals each day. Consider whey protein between meals and aslow-digesting casein proteinÂ as a shake or puddingÂ to help fuel your gains at night.
