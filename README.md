      *Spring Boot* is an open-source Java framework that simplifies the development of production-ready, stand-alone Spring-based applications. It provides a convention-over-configuration approach, reducing boilerplate code and configuration, and integrates seamlessly with the Spring ecosystem. With built-in support for embedded servers, dependency management, and auto-configuration, Spring Boot enables developers to rapidly build and deploy robust, scalable, and easily maintainable applications. It promotes best practices and focuses on convention, allowing developers to concentrate on business logic rather than complex setups, making it an excellent choice for building microservices and modern web applications.
- ### Machine learning model
  - **TensorFlow&Keras**

    - **TensorFlow**
      
      ***TensorFlow*** is an open-source machine learning framework developed by the Google Brain team. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources for building and deploying machine learning models. TensorFlow supports both deep learning and traditional machine learning, offering flexibility for a wide range of applications. Its core functionality involves defining, training, and deploying machine learning models, utilizing computational graphs to represent complex computations.
    - **Keras**
   
      ***Keras*** is a high-level neural networks API written in Python that serves as an interface for building and training neural networks. Originally a separate library, Keras has been integrated as the official high-level API into TensorFlow since version 2.0. Keras abstracts and simplifies the construction of neural networks, offering a user-friendly interface without sacrificing flexibility. It allows rapid prototyping of deep learning models, emphasizing modularity, ease of use, and extensibility. Keras can run seamlessly on top of various deep learning frameworks, with TensorFlow being the primary backend.
